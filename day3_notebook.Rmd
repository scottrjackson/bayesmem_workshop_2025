# Agenda

- Review, recap
- Spend some more time playing with priors, etc. with a simple model
- Start using `brms` to fit MEMs, comparing with `lme4`
- Discuss the challenges of parameterization

# Review & recap

- Michael's question about "between Bayesian and Frequentist"
- walk through the "simple regression" Stan file
- Spend a little more time playing with priors and other settings

# The `brms` package and adventures in parameterization


# Fitting MEMs with `brms` and Stan
